## Portfolio Construction
The portfolio is intended to be exposed to a global market. As such its weights are designed to be a function of each coutry's or continent's population.
I chose ETF's that, when taken as a group, represented the globe.
Their weight were set soley on the percentage of the global population that resides in their borders.
